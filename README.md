# Oracle Technical Challenge

A takehome UI React project done by Kevin Tan, as part of Oracle's technical challenge for the position of UI/UX Software Engineer.
The project had to be completed within 1 week.

Technologies used for this project:  
- Next.js (React.js)
- TailwindCSS
- Redux
- Jest and React Testing Library
- Cypress

Languages used: 
- TypeScript / JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5 / CSS3

Other tools:
- Prettier
- ESLint (Airbnb config)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.



To run Jest,

```bash
npm test  
or  
npm run test  
```

To run Cypress,

```bash
npm run cypress
```
